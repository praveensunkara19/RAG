The quality of these representations\\nis measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previ-\\nously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We\\nobserve large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it\\ntakes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words\\ndata set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art perfor-\\nmance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.\\n1 Introduction\\nMany current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\\nity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has several good\\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words). In\\nmachine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words\\nor less. Thus, there are situations where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in\\nany signiﬁcant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\\nWith progress of machine learning techniques in recent years, it has become possible to train more\\ncomplex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. Probably\\nthe most successful concept is to use distributed representations of words [10]. For example, neural\\nnetwork based language models signiﬁcantly outperform N-gram models [1, 27, 17].\\n1.1 Goals of the Paper\\nThe main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word\\nvectors from huge data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary.

This has been observed earlier in the context\\nof inﬂectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for\\nsimilar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to ﬁnd words that have similar\\nendings [13, 14].\\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple\\nsyntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are per-\\nformed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vec-\\ntor(”Woman”) results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the wordQueen [20].\\nIn this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model\\narchitectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test\\nset for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities 1, and show that many such regularities\\ncan be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss how training time and accuracy depends\\non the dimensionality of the word vectors and on the amount of the training data.\\n1.2 Previous Work\\nRepresentation of words as continuous vectors has a long history [10, 26, 8]. A very popular model\\narchitecture for estimating neural network language model (NNLM) was proposed in [1], where a\\nfeedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to\\nlearn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been\\nfollowed by many others.\\nAnother interesting architecture of NNLM was presented in [13, 14], where the word vectors are\\nﬁrst learned using neural network with a single hidden layer. The word vectors are then used to train\\nthe NNLM. Thus, the word vectors are learned even without constructing the full NNLM. In this\\nwork, we directly extend this architecture, and focus just on the ﬁrst step where the word vectors are\\nlearned using a simple model.\\nIt was later shown that the word vectors can be used to signiﬁcantly improve and simplify many\\nNLP applications [4, 5, 29]. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different\\nmodel architectures and trained on various corpora [4, 29, 23, 19, 9], and some of the resulting word\\nvectors were made available for future research and comparison2. However, as far as we know, these\\narchitectures were signiﬁcantly more computationally expensive for training than the one proposed\\nin [13], with the exception of certain version of log-bilinear model where diagonal weight matrices\\nare used [23].\\n2 Model Architectures\\nMany different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words,\\nincluding the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\\nIn this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, as it was\\npreviously shown that they perform signiﬁcantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities\\namong words [20, 31]; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets.\\nSimilar to [18], to compare different model architectures we deﬁne ﬁrst the computational complex-\\nity of a model as the number of parameters that need to be accessed to fully train the model. Next,\\nwe will try to maximize the accuracy, while minimizing the computational complexity.\\n1The test set is available at www.fit.vutbr.cz/˜imikolov/rnnlm/word-test.v1.txt\\n2http://ronan.collobert.com/senna/\\nhttp://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/\\nhttp://www.fit.vutbr.cz/˜imikolov/rnnlm/\\nhttp://ai.stanford.edu/˜ehhuang/\\n2'),\n",

Common choice is E = 3− 50 and T up to one billion.\\nAll models are trained using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation [26].\\n2.1 Feedforward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)\\nThe probabilistic feedforward neural network language model has been proposed in [1]. It consists\\nof input, projection, hidden and output layers. At the input layer, N previous words are encoded\\nusing 1-of- V coding, where V is size of the vocabulary. The input layer is then projected to a\\nprojection layer P that has dimensionality N × D, using a shared projection matrix. As only N\\ninputs are active at any given time, composition of the projection layer is a relatively cheap operation.\\nThe NNLM architecture becomes complex for computation between the projection and the hidden\\nlayer, as values in the projection layer are dense. For a common choice of N = 10, the size of the\\nprojection layer (P) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size H is typically 500 to 1000\\nunits. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the\\nvocabulary, resulting in an output layer with dimensionalityV . Thus, the computational complexity\\nper each training example is\\nQ = N × D + N × D × H + H × V, (2)\\nwhere the dominating term is H × V . However, several practical solutions were proposed for\\navoiding it; either using hierarchical versions of the softmax [25, 23, 18], or avoiding normalized\\nmodels completely by using models that are not normalized during training [4, 9]. With binary tree\\nrepresentations of the vocabulary, the number of output units that need to be evaluated can go down\\nto around log2(V ). Thus, most of the complexity is caused by the term N × D × H.\\nIn our models, we use hierarchical softmax where the vocabulary is represented as a Huffman binary\\ntree. This follows previous observations that the frequency of words works well for obtaining classes\\nin neural net language models [16]. Huffman trees assign short binary codes to frequent words, and\\nthis further reduces the number of output units that need to be evaluated: while balanced binary tree\\nwould require log2(V ) outputs to be evaluated, the Huffman tree based hierarchical softmax requires\\nonly about log2(Unigram perplexity(V )). For example when the vocabulary size is one million\\nwords, this results in about two times speedup in evaluation. While this is not crucial speedup for\\nneural network LMs as the computational bottleneck is in theN ×D×H term, we will later propose\\narchitectures that do not have hidden layers and thus depend heavily on the efﬁciency of the softmax\\nnormalization.\\n2.2 Recurrent Neural Net Language Model (RNNLM)\\nRecurrent neural network based language model has been proposed to overcome certain limitations\\nof the feedforward NNLM, such as the need to specify the context length (the order of the modelN),\\nand because theoretically RNNs can efﬁciently represent more complex patterns than the shallow\\nneural networks [15, 2]. The RNN model does not have a projection layer; only input, hidden and\\noutput layer. What is special for this type of model is the recurrent matrix that connects hidden\\nlayer to itself, using time-delayed connections. This allows the recurrent model to form some kind\\nof short term memory, as information from the past can be represented by the hidden layer state that\\ngets updated based on the current input and the state of the hidden layer in the previous time step.\\nThe complexity per training example of the RNN model is\\nQ = H × H + H × V, (3)\\nwhere the word representations D have the same dimensionality as the hidden layer H. Again, the\\nterm H × V can be efﬁciently reduced to H × log2(V ) by using hierarchical softmax. Most of the\\ncomplexity then comes from H × H.\\n3'),\n",

The framework allows us to run multiple replicas of the same model in\\nparallel, and each replica synchronizes its gradient updates through a centralized server that keeps\\nall the parameters. For this parallel training, we use mini-batch asynchronous gradient descent with\\nan adaptive learning rate procedure called Adagrad [7]. Under this framework, it is common to use\\none hundred or more model replicas, each using many CPU cores at different machines in a data\\ncenter.\\n3 New Log-linear Models\\nIn this section, we propose two new model architectures for learning distributed representations\\nof words that try to minimize computational complexity. The main observation from the previous\\nsection was that most of the complexity is caused by the non-linear hidden layer in the model. While\\nthis is what makes neural networks so attractive, we decided to explore simpler models that might\\nnot be able to represent the data as precisely as neural networks, but can possibly be trained on much\\nmore data efﬁciently.\\nThe new architectures directly follow those proposed in our earlier work [13, 14], where it was\\nfound that neural network language model can be successfully trained in two steps: ﬁrst, continuous\\nword vectors are learned using simple model, and then the N-gram NNLM is trained on top of these\\ndistributed representations of words. While there has been later substantial amount of work that\\nfocuses on learning word vectors, we consider the approach proposed in [13] to be the simplest one.\\nNote that related models have been proposed also much earlier [26, 8].\\n3.1 Continuous Bag-of-Words Model\\nThe ﬁrst proposed architecture is similar to the feedforward NNLM, where the non-linear hidden\\nlayer is removed and the projection layer is shared for all words (not just the projection matrix);\\nthus, all words get projected into the same position (their vectors are averaged). We call this archi-\\ntecture a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the history does not inﬂuence the projection.\\nFurthermore, we also use words from the future; we have obtained the best performance on the task\\nintroduced in the next section by building a log-linear classiﬁer with four future and four history\\nwords at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current (middle) word.\\nTraining complexity is then\\nQ = N × D + D × log2(V ). (4)\\nWe denote this model further as CBOW, as unlike standard bag-of-words model, it uses continuous\\ndistributed representation of the context. The model architecture is shown at Figure 1. Note that the\\nweight matrix between the input and the projection layer is shared for all word positions in the same\\nway as in the NNLM.\\n3.2 Continuous Skip-gram Model\\nThe second architecture is similar to CBOW, but instead of predicting the current word based on the\\ncontext, it tries to maximize classiﬁcation of a word based on another word in the same sentence.\\nMore precisely, we use each current word as an input to a log-linear classiﬁer with continuous\\nprojection layer, and predict words within a certain range before and after the current word. We\\nfound that increasing the range improves quality of the resulting word vectors, but it also increases\\nthe computational complexity. Since the more distant words are usually less related to the current\\nword than those close to it, we give less weight to the distant words by sampling less from those\\nwords in our training examples.\\nThe training complexity of this architecture is proportional to\\nQ = C × (D + D × log2(V )), (5)\\nwhere C is the maximum distance of the words. Thus, if we choose C = 5, for each training word\\nwe will select randomly a number R in range < 1; C >, and then use R words from history and\\n4'),\n",

Although\\nit is easy to show that word France is similar to Italy and perhaps some other countries, it is much\\nmore challenging when subjecting those vectors in a more complex similarity task, as follows. We\\nfollow previous observation that there can be many different types of similarities between words, for\\nexample, word big is similar to bigger in the same sense that small is similar to smaller. Example\\nof another type of relationship can be word pairs big - biggest and small - smallest [20]. We further\\ndenote two pairs of words with the same relationship as a question, as we can ask: ”What is the\\nword that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big?”\\nSomewhat surprisingly, these questions can be answered by performing simple algebraic operations\\nwith the vector representation of words. To ﬁnd a word that is similar to small in the same sense as\\nbiggest is similar to big, we can simply compute vectorX = vector(”biggest”) −vector(”big”) +\\nvector(”small”). Then, we search in the vector space for the word closest toX measured by cosine\\ndistance, and use it as the answer to the question (we discard the input question words during this\\nsearch). When the word vectors are well trained, it is possible to ﬁnd the correct answer (word\\nsmallest) using this method.\\nFinally, we found that when we train high dimensional word vectors on a large amount of data, the\\nresulting vectors can be used to answer very subtle semantic relationships between words, such as\\na city and the country it belongs to, e.g. France is to Paris as Germany is to Berlin. Word vectors\\nwith such semantic relationships could be used to improve many existing NLP applications, such\\nas machine translation, information retrieval and question answering systems, and may enable other\\nfuture applications yet to be invented.\\n5'),\n",

Two examples from each category are\\nshown in Table 1. Overall, there are 8869 semantic and 10675 syntactic questions. The questions\\nin each category were created in two steps: ﬁrst, a list of similar word pairs was created manually.\\nThen, a large list of questions is formed by connecting two word pairs. For example, we made a\\nlist of 68 large American cities and the states they belong to, and formed about 2.5K questions by\\npicking two word pairs at random. We have included in our test set only single token words, thus\\nmulti-word entities are not present (such as New York).\\nWe evaluate the overall accuracy for all question types, and for each question type separately (se-\\nmantic, syntactic). Question is assumed to be correctly answered only if the closest word to the\\nvector computed using the above method is exactly the same as the correct word in the question;\\nsynonyms are thus counted as mistakes. This also means that reaching 100% accuracy is likely\\nto be impossible, as the current models do not have any input information about word morphology.\\nHowever, we believe that usefulness of the word vectors for certain applications should be positively\\ncorrelated with this accuracy metric. Further progress can be achieved by incorporating information\\nabout structure of words, especially for the syntactic questions.\\n4.2 Maximization of Accuracy\\nWe have used a Google News corpus for training the word vectors.

In the further experiments, we\\nuse full set of questions in the new Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship test set, i.e. unrestricted to\\nthe 30k vocabulary. We also include results on a test set introduced in [20] that focuses on syntactic\\nsimilarity between words3.\\nThe training data consists of several LDC corpora and is described in detail in [18] (320M words,\\n82K vocabulary). We used these data to provide a comparison to a previously trained recurrent\\nneural network language model that took about 8 weeks to train on a single CPU. We trained a feed-\\nforward NNLM with the same number of 640 hidden units using the DistBelief parallel training [6],\\nusing a history of 8 previous words (thus, the NNLM has more parameters than the RNNLM, as the\\nprojection layer has size 640 × 8).\\nIn Table 3, it can be seen that the word vectors from the RNN (as used in [20]) perform well mostly\\non the syntactic questions. The NNLM vectors perform signiﬁcantly better than the RNN - this is\\nnot surprising, as the word vectors in the RNNLM are directly connected to a non-linear hidden\\nlayer. The CBOW architecture works better than the NNLM on the syntactic tasks, and about the\\nsame on the semantic one. Finally, the Skip-gram architecture works slightly worse on the syntactic\\ntask than the CBOW model (but still better than the NNLM), and much better on the semantic part\\nof the test than all the other models.\\nNext, we evaluated our models trained using one CPU only and compared the results against publicly\\navailable word vectors. The comparison is given in Table 4. The CBOW model was trained on subset\\n3We thank Geoff Zweig for providing us the test set.\\n7'),\n",

This task consists of 1040 sentences, where one\\nword is missing in each sentence and the goal is to select word that is the most coherent with the\\nrest of the sentence, given a list of ﬁve reasonable choices. Performance of several techniques has\\nbeen already reported on this set, including N-gram models, LSA-based model [32], log-bilinear\\nmodel [24] and a combination of recurrent neural networks that currently holds the state of the art\\nperformance of 55.4% accuracy on this benchmark [19].\\nWe have explored the performance of Skip-gram architecture on this task. First, we train the 640-\\ndimensional model on 50M words provided in [32]. Then, we compute score of each sentence in\\nthe test set by using the unknown word at the input, and predict all surrounding words in a sentence.\\nThe ﬁnal sentence score is then the sum of these individual predictions. Using the sentence scores,\\nwe choose the most likely sentence.\\nA short summary of some previous results together with the new results is presented in Table 7.\\nWhile the Skip-gram model itself does not perform on this task better than LSA similarity, the scores\\nfrom this model are complementary to scores obtained with RNNLMs, and a weighted combination\\nleads to a new state of the art result 58.9% accuracy (59.2% on the development part of the set and\\n58.7% on the test part of the set).\\n5 Examples of the Learned Relationships\\nTable 8 shows words that follow various relationships. We follow the approach described above: the\\nrelationship is deﬁned by subtracting two word vectors, and the result is added to another word. Thus\\nfor example, Paris - France + Italy = Rome . As it can be seen, accuracy is quite good, although\\nthere is clearly a lot of room for further improvements (note that using our accuracy metric that\\n9'),\n",

Clearly, there is still a lot of discoveries to be made using these techniques.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn this paper we studied the quality of vector representations of words derived by various models on\\na collection of syntactic and semantic language tasks. We observed that it is possible to train high\\nquality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network\\nmodels (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, it\\nis possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set.\\nUsing the DistBelief distributed framework, it should be possible to train the CBOW and Skip-gram\\nmodels even on corpora with one trillion words, for basically unlimited size of the vocabulary. That\\nis several orders of magnitude larger than the best previously published results for similar models.\\nAn interesting task where the word vectors have recently been shown to signiﬁcantly outperform the\\nprevious state of the art is the SemEval-2012 Task 2 [11]. The publicly available RNN vectors were\\nused together with other techniques to achieve over 50% increase in Spearman’s rank correlation\\nover the previous best result [31]. The neural network based word vectors were previously applied\\nto many other NLP tasks, for example sentiment analysis [12] and paraphrase detection [28]. It can\\nbe expected that these applications can beneﬁt from the model architectures described in this paper.\\nOur ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension\\nof facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for veriﬁcation of correctness of existing facts. Results\\nfrom machine translation experiments also look very promising. In the future, it would be also\\ninteresting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [30] and others. We believe that\\nour comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for\\nestimating the word vectors. We also expect that high quality word vectors will become an important\\nbuilding block for future NLP applications.\\n10'),\n",

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length.

We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality.

In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a mass of\\napplications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks\\nrepetitively and with little variation.\\nHere we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are sufficiently\\npowerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical for many\\ninvocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the future of agentic AI . Our\\nargumentation is grounded in the current level of capabilities exhibited by SLMs,\\nthe common architectures of agentic systems, and the economy of LM deployment.\\nWe further argue that in situations where general-purpose conversational abilities\\nare essential, heterogeneous agentic systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different\\nmodels) are the natural choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption\\nof SLMs in agentic systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion\\nalgorithm.\\nOur position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of\\nthe operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs\\nis to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion on\\nthe effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower\\nthe costs of AI of the present day.

Recent surveys show that more\\nthan a half of large IT enterprises are actively using AI agents, with 21% having adopted just within\\nthe last year [12]. Aside from the users, markets also see substantial economic value in AI agents: As\\nof late 2024, the agentic AI sector had seen more than USD 2bn in startup funding, was valued at\\nUSD 5.2bn, and was expected to grow to nearly USD 200bn by 2034 [42, 47]. Put plainly, there is a\\ngrowing expectation that AI agents will play a substantial role in the modern economy.\\nThe core components powering most modern AI agents are (very) large language models [48, 44]. It\\nis the LLMs that provide the foundational intelligence that enables agents to make strategic decisions\\nabout when and how to use available tools, control the flow of operations needed to complete tasks,\\nand, if necessary, to break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks and to perform reasoning\\nfor action planning and problem-solving [48, 14]. A typical AI agent then simply communicates with\\na chosen LLM API endpoint by making requests to centralized cloud infrastructure that hosts these\\nmodels [48].\\nPreprint. Under review.'),\n",

This operational model is deeply ingrained in the industry — so deeply ingrained, in\\nfact, that it forms the foundation of substantial capital bets: While the market for the LLM API serving\\nthat underlies agentic applications was estimated at USD 5.6bn in 2024 [ 26], the investment into\\nthe hosting cloud infrastructure surged to USD 57bn in the same year [72]. The 10-fold discrepancy\\nbetween investment and market size has been accepted, because it is assumed that this operational\\nmodel will remain the cornerstone of the industry without any substantial alterations, and that the\\nlarge initial investment will deliver returns comparable to traditional software and internet solutions\\nwithin 3-4 years [53].\\nIn this work, we recognize the dominance of the standard operational model but verbally challenge\\none of its aspects, namely the custom that the agents’ requests to access language intelligence are –\\nin spite of their comparative simplicity – handled by singleton choices of generalist LLMs. We state\\n(Section 2), argue (Section 3), and defend (Section 4) the position that the small, rather than large,\\nlanguage models are the future of agentic AI. We, however, recognize the business commitment\\nand the now-legacy praxis that is the cause for the contrary state of the present (Section 5). In remedy,\\nwe provide an outline of a conversion algorithm for the migration of agentic applications from LLMs\\nto SLMs (Section 6), and call for a wider discussion (Section 7). If needed to concretize our stance,\\nwe attach a set of short case studies estimating the potential extent of LLM-to-SLM replacement in\\nselected popular open-source agents (Appendix B).\\n2 Position\\n2.1 Definitions\\nFor the purpose of concretizing our position, we use the following working definitions:\\nWD1 A SLM is a LM that can fit onto a common consumer electronic device and perform inference\\nwith latency sufficiently low to be practical when serving the agentic requests of one user.\\nWD2 An LLM is a LM that is not a SLM.\\nWe justify the wording of these definitions in Appendix A, but note that their choice has little bearing\\non the essence of our position. We note that as of 2025, we would be comfortable with considering\\nmost models below 10bn parameters in size to be SLMs.\\nWe use the words agent and agentic system interchangeably, preferring the former when emphasizing\\nthe software with some agency as a whole (e.g., “as seen in popular coding agents”) and the latter\\nwhen highlighting the systems aspect of the agentic application as a sum of its components (e.g.,\\n“not all LMs of an agentic system are replaceable by SLMs”). For brevity, we focus on LMs as the\\nbedrock of agentic applications and do not explicitly consider vision-language models, although we\\nnote that our position and most of our arguments readily extend to vision-language models as well.\\n2.2 Statement\\nWe contend that SLMs are\\nV1 principally sufficiently powerful to handle language modeling errands of agentic appli-\\ncations;\\nV2 inherently more operationally suitable for use in agentic systems than LLMs;\\nV3 necessarily more economical for the vast majority of LM uses in agentic systems than\\ntheir general-purpose LLM counterparts by the virtue of their smaller size;\\nand that on the basis of views V1–V3 SLMs are the future of agentic AI.\\nThe phrasing of our position is deliberate. In its statement, we wish to convey that the described\\nfuture development is ultimately a necessary consequence of the differences between SLMs and\\nLLMs if the natural priorities are followed.

While LLMs offer impressive generality and\\nconversational fluency, the majority of agenticsubtasks in deployed agentic systems are repetitive,\\nscoped, and non-conversational—calling for models that are efficient, predictable, and inexpensive.\\nIn this context, SLMs not only suffice, but are often preferable. They offer several advantages: lower\\nlatency, reduced memory and computational requirements, and significantly lower operational costs,\\nall while maintaining adequate task performance in constrained domains.\\nOur position stems from a pragmatic view of language model usage patterns within agentic architec-\\ntures. These systems typically decompose complex goals into modular sub-tasks, each of which can\\nbe reliably handled by specialized or fine-tuned SLMs. We argue that insisting on LLMs for all such\\ntasks reflects a misallocation of computational resources—one that is economically inefficient and\\nenvironmentally unsustainable at scale.\\nMoreover, in cases where general reasoning or open-domain dialogue is essential, we advocate for\\nheterogeneous agentic systems, where SLMs are used by default and LLMs are invoked selectively\\nand sparingly. This modular composition — combining the precision and efficiency of SLMs with\\nthe generality of LLMs — enables the construction of agents that are both cost-effective and capable.\\nUltimately, we observe that shifting the paradigm from LLM-centric to SLM-first architectures\\nrepresents to many not only a technical refinement but also a Humean moral ought. As the AI\\ncommunity grapples with rising infrastructure costs and environmental concerns, adopting and\\nnormalizing the use of SLMs in agentic workflows can play a crucial role in promoting responsible\\nand sustainable AI deployment.\\n3 Position Arguments\\nWe support views V1–V3 by the following non-exclusive arguments.\\n3.1 SLMs are already sufficiently powerful for use in agents\\nA1 SLMs are sufficiently powerful to take the place of LLMs in agentic systems.

On a closer look, however, much of the signals passing through these systems\\nis sparse, engaging only a fraction of their parameters for any single input [65, 41]. That\\nthis behavior appears to be more subdued in SLMs [ 65, 71] suggests that SLMs may be\\nfundamentally more efficient by the virtue of having a smaller proportion of their parameters\\ncontribute to the inference cost without a tangible effect on the output.\\nModular system design. The position outlined in [ 52] presents a thorough argument in favor of\\ncomposite agentic systems. Here we note that the approach of leveraging several models of varying\\nsizes aligns well with the real-world heterogeneity of agentic tasks and is already slowly being\\nincorporated into major software development frameworks [25]. Furthermore, this newly discovered\\nsense for modularity in the context of agents allows for the easy addition of new skills and the ability\\nto adapt to changing requirements, and is consistent with the push for modularity in language model\\ndesign [24, 10, 37].\\nThe above-mentioned “Lego-like” composition of agentic intelligence—scaling out by adding small,\\nspecialized experts instead of scaling up monolithic models—yields systems that are cheaper, faster\\nto debug, easier to deploy, and better aligned with the operational diversity of real-world agents.\\nWhen combined with tool calling, caching, and fine-grained routing, SLM-first architectures appear\\nto offer the best path forward for cost-effective, modular, and sustainable agentic AI.\\n3.3 SLMs are more flexible\\nA3 SLMs possess greater operational flexibility in comparison to LLMs. This argument stands\\nin support of views V2 and V3.\\nDue to their small size and the associated reduction in pre-training and fine-tuning costs (Section 3.2),\\nSLMs are inherently more flexible than their large counterparts when appearing in agentic systems. As\\nsuch, it becomes much more affordable and practical to train, adapt, and deploy multiple specialized\\nexpert models for different agentic routines. This efficiency enables rapid iteration and adaptation,\\nmaking it feasible to address evolving user needs, including supporting new behaviors, meeting new\\noutput formatting requirements, and complying with changing local regulation in selected markets\\n[69, 38, 68].\\nDemocratization. One particularly notable and desirable consequence of SLM flexibility when put\\nin place of LLMs is the ensuing democratization of agents. When more individuals and organizations\\ncan participate in developing language models with the aim for deployment in agentic systems, the\\naggregate population of agents is more likely to represent a more diverse range of perspectives and\\nsocietal needs. This diversity can then help with reducing the risk of systemic biases and encourage\\ncompetition and innovation.

This is addressed in Section 4.1.\\n3.5 Agentic interactions necessitate close behavioral alignment\\nA5 Agentic interactions necessitate close behavioral alignment. This aligns with view V2.\\nA typical AI agent has frequent interactions with code, be it through LM tool calling or by returning\\noutput that is to be parsed by a piece of agentic code that makes the LM call [48]. It is essential for\\nthe success of these interactions that the generated tool call and the generated output conform to strict\\nformatting requirements imposed on it by the order, typing, and nature of the tool’s parameters, and\\nthe expectation of the code invoking the LM, respectively. In such cases, it becomes unnecessary\\nfor the model to handle multiple different formats (e.g. JSON/XML/Python for tool calls and\\nXML/Y AML/Markdown/Latex for output [50]), as only one would be chosen for consistency across\\nthe agentic application. It is also undesirable for the model to make the occasional hallucinatory\\nmistake and respond in a format different from that being expected by the “code parts” of the agentic\\nsystem. It is because of this that the SLM trained with a single formatting decision enforced during\\nits post-training or encouraged through additional fine-tuning at a low cost is preferable over a\\ngeneral-purpose LLM in the context of AI agents.\\n3.6 Agentic systems are naturally heterogeneous\\nA6 Agentic systems naturally allow for heterogeneity in the selection of models that they use.\\nThis aligns with view V2.\\nA language model can itself be a tool called by another language model. Likewise, every time the\\nagent’s code invokes a language model, it can, in principle, choose any language model. This is\\nillustrated in Figure 1. We argue that incorporating multiple language models of different sizes and\\ncapabilities for queries or operations of different levels of complexity offers a natural way for the\\nintroduction of SLMs. In the context of Figure 1- Left, an LLM can be used for the model with\\nthe root agency, while a SLM could be used for the subordinate LM. In Figure 1- Right, all LMs\\ncould in principle be specialized SLMs: one for conversationality, another one for carrying out\\ncontroller-defined language modeling tasks.\\n3.7 Agentic interactions are natural pathways for gathering data for future improvement\\nA7 Agentic interactions are a good source for data for future model improvement. This is\\nfundamentally supportive of view V2.\\nAs noted in Section 3.4, invocations of tools and language models during an agentic process are\\noften accompanied by careful prompting that focuses the language model on delivering the narrow\\nfunctionality that is required at the time. Each one of these invocations is itself a natural source of\\ndata for future improvement (under the necessary assumption that no non-retainable confidential\\ndata is being processed). A listener decorating the tool/model call interface can gather specialized\\ninstruction data that can later be used to produce a fine-tune an expert SLM and lower the cost of that\\ncall in the future (see logger in Figure 1). We argue that this avenue is enabled by the architecture\\nof agents [48] and produces high-quality organic data (that can be further post-filtered by considering\\nthe overall success of the workflow), thus making the production of expert SLMs to stand in place of\\nLLMs a natural step in agent deployment — not just an auxiliary effort.\\n4 Alternative Views\\nThe following significant alternative views have been expressed in the academic and popular literature.\\n6'),\n",

LLMs acquire their language understanding capabilities in accordance with scaling\\nlaws [15]. Their larger scale then enables them to demonstrate better performance across a\\nwide array of specialized natural language tasks, including text generation, translation, and\\nreasoning, outperforming small models trained both (a) in the same general fashion and (b)\\nfrom scratch specifically for these tasks [54]. It can then be said that to claim otherwise is to\\ncontradict the LM scaling laws [29, 28].\\nCA2 Moreover, recent studies also purport that LLMs possess a “semantic hub” mechanism,\\nwhich has been hypothesized to enable them to integrate and abstract semantic information\\nfrom various modalities and languages in a generalized manner [77]. If true, LLMs could be\\nthought to generalize knowledge across languages and domains far more effectively than\\nsmaller models, which under the same study lack the capacity for the presence of such a\\nhub [77]. It can then argued that while small language models may be efficient for narrowly\\ndefined or highly specialized tasks, their limited scale fundamentally restricts their ability\\nto achieve the same level of general language understanding in these specialized as LLMs\\nbecause of the lack of room for the internalization of complex abstractions.\\nA conclusion can be then drawn that LLM generalist models will always retain the advantage of\\nuniversally better performance on language tasks, no matter how narrowly defined, over small\\nlanguage models of the same generation. This to be to their advantage over SLMs when deployed in\\nagentic applications.\\nRebuttal. The above alternative view is the most popularly cited belief against the use of SLMs,\\neven when only a narrow language task needs to be performed [2, 67, 27, 1].\\nWe believe that counter-argumentCA1 is too limited to attack view V2, namely because\\nA8 Popular scaling law studies assume the model architecture to be kept constant [29, 28] within\\nthe same generation, whereas the recent work on small language model training demonstrates\\nthat there are distinct performance benefits to considering different architectures for different\\nmodel sizes [20, 7].\\nA9 The flexibility of small language models (Section 3.3) comes to the rescue. A small language\\nmodel can be easily fine-tuned for the task T of alternative view A V1to perform to the\\ndesired level of reliability. This is unaccounted for in scaling law studies.\\nA10 Reasoning (or, more generally, test-time compute scaling; see Section 3.2) is significantly\\nmore affordable. A small language model, still retaining its benefits of greater cross-device\\nagility can be reasonable expected to be scalable at inference time to the desired level of\\nreliability.\\nWe also believe that counter-argumentCA2 is too arcane to attack view V2 because\\nA11 The utility of the purported “semantic hub” shows itself when tasks or inputs at hand to be\\nprocessed by the LM are complex. However, advanced agentic systems are either designed in\\ntheir entirety or at least actively prompted to perform decompositions of complex problems\\nand inputs [48, 14]. Therefore, we argue to the contrary that invocations of small language\\nmodels within agentic systems would be on appropriately broken-down into sub-tasks so\\nsimple that any general abstract understanding due to the hub would be of little utility.\\n4.2 LLM inference will still be cheaper because of their centralization\\nA V2The per-token inference cost benefit of the smallness of specialized SLMs in agentic\\napplications is dwarfed by the economy of scale.\\n7'),\n",

We acknowledge that alternative view A V2is a valid view, with the exact\\neconomical considerations being highly case-specific. We believe that the jury is still out on alternative\\nview A V2, but that several factors hint that view V3 might prevail:\\nA12 Recent improvements in inference scheduling and large inference system modularization\\noffer unprecedented levels of inference system flexibility in monolithic computing clusters\\n[82, 56, 46], countering the traditional stance expressed in counter-argument CA3.\\nA13 The most recent analyses on the set-up costs of inference infrastructure indicate a consistent\\nfalling trend due to underlying technological reasons [79, 4].\\n4.3 Equally possible worlds\\nA V3Both the agentic world utilizing SLMs and agentic world utilizing LLMs are equally possible\\nworlds, but the “LLM agentic world” has a considerable head start in terms of deployment\\npractice and optimization, and the industry inertia already funnels efforts into innovation\\nsolely in that direction.\\nAcknowledgment. We acknowledge alternative viewA V3as a distinct possibility, but maintain the\\nposition that the weight of advantages described across arguments A1–A7 can plausibily overturn the\\npresent state of affairs.\\n5 Barriers to Adoption\\nIt would be prudent to ask oneself: If the arguments A1–A7 are truly compelling, why do the ever\\nnewer generations of agents seemingly just perpetuate the status quo of using generalist LLMs?\\nWe believe the following to be among the today’s main barriers to wide-spread adoption of SLMs:\\nB1 Large amounts of upfront investment into centralized LLM inference infrastructure.\\nAs detailed in Section 1, large capital bets have been made on the centralized LLM inference\\nbeing the leading paradigm in providing AI services in the future. As such, the industry\\nhas been much quicker at building the tools and infrastructure to that end, omitting any\\nconsiderations for the possibility that more decentralized SLM or on-device inference might\\nbe equally feasible in the near future.\\nB2 Use of generalist benchmarks in SLM training, design, and evaluation. It must be\\npointed out that much of the work on SLM design and development follows the tracks of\\nLLM design, focusing on the same generalist benchmarks in their development [43, 57]. On\\nthis point, [20] notes that if one focuses solely on benchmarks measuring the agentic utility\\nof agents, the studied SLMs easily outperform larger models.\\nB3 Lack of popular awareness. SLMs often do not receive the level of marketing intensity\\nand press attention LLMs do, despite their better suitability in many industrial scenarios.\\nWe note that barriers B1–B3 are practical hurdles and far from being fundamental flaws of the SLM\\ntechnology in the context of agentic AI. With advanced inference scheduling systems such as Dynamo\\n[21], barrier B1 is being reduced to a mere effect of inertia. barrier B2 is becoming increasingly\\nrecognized in the field [ 20, 34], and it would be natural for barrier B3 to fall once the economic\\nbenefits of SLM deployment in agentic applications (argument A2) are better known. With the inertia\\nof barrier B1 in particular, we do not endeavor to give a timeline for the retreat of these barriers or\\nthe popular adoption of SLMs.\\n8'),\n",

In the following steps, we outline an algorithm\\nthat describes one possible way to carry out the change of the underlying model painlessly.\\nS1 Secure usage data collection. The initial step involves deploying instrumentation to log\\nall non-HCI agent calls, capturing input prompts, output responses, contents of individual\\ntool calls, and optionally latency metrics for a later targeted optimization. In terms of\\nimplementation, it is the recommended practice to set up encrypted logging pipelines with\\nrole-based access controls [51] and anonymize all data with respect to its origins before\\nstorage [70]. See logger in Figure 1 for an illustration.\\nS2 Data curation and filtering. Begin collecting data through the pipelines of step S1. Once\\na satisfactory amount of data has been collected (10k-100k examples being sufficient for\\nfine-tuning of small models as a rule of thumb [5, 19]), it is necessary to remove any PII,\\nPHI, or any other application-specific sensitive data that could cause a data leak across\\nuser accounts once used to produce a SLM specialist. Many typical varieties of sensitive\\ndata can be detected and masked or removed using popular automated tools for dataset\\npreparation [60, 58]. Application specific inputs (e.g. legal or internal documents) can\\nbe often be automatically paraphrased to obfuscate named entities and numerical details\\nwithout compromising the general information content [9, 76, 73].\\nS3 Task clustering. Employ unsupervised clustering techniques on the collected prompts\\nand agent actions to identify recurring patterns of requests or internal agent operations\\n[32, 39, 18]. These clusters help define candidate tasks for SLM specialization. The\\ngranularity of tasks will depend on the diversity of operations; common examples include\\nintent recognition, data extraction, summarization of specific document types, or code\\ngeneration with respect to tools available to the agent.\\nS4 SLM selection. For each identified task, select one or more candidate SLMs. Criteria for\\nselection include the SLM’s inherent capabilities (e.g., instruction following, reasoning,\\ncontext window size), its performance on relevant benchmarks for the task type, its licensing,\\nand its deployment footprint (memory, computational requirements). Models of Section 3.2\\nserve as good starting candidates.\\nS5 Specialized SLM fine-tuning. For each selected task and corresponding SLM candidate,\\nprepare a task-specific dataset from the curated data collected in steps S2 and S3. Then, fine-\\ntune the chosen SLMs on these specialized datasets. PEFT techniques such as LoRA [31]\\nor QLoRA [17] can be leveraged to reduce computational costs and memory requirements\\nassociated with fine-tuning, making the process more accessible. Full fine-tuning can also\\nbe considered if resources permit and maximal adaptation is required. In some cases, it may\\nbe beneficial to use knowledge distillation, where the specialist SLM is trained to mimic\\nthe outputs of the more powerful generalist LLM on the task-specific dataset. This can help\\ntransfer some of the more nuanced capabilities of the LLM to the SLM.\\nS6 Iteration and refinement. One may retrain the SLMs and the router model periodically\\nwith new data to maintain performance and adapt to evolving usage patterns. This forms a\\ncontinuous improvement loop, returning to step S2 or step S4 as appropriate.\\n7 Call for Discussion\\nThe agentic AI industry is showing the signs of a promise to have a transformative effect on white\\ncollar work and beyond.\\nIt is the view of the authors that any expense savings or improvements on the sustainability of AI\\ninfrastructure would act as a catalyst for this transformation, and that it is thus eminently desirable to\\nexplore all options for doing so.\\nWe therefore call for both contributions to and critique of our position, to be di-\\nrected to agents@nvidia.com, and commit to publishing all such correspondence at\\nresearch.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents.\\n9'),\n",

The definition should be timeless: It should avoiding dependence on\\nhardware-specific metrics like parameter count or FLOPs, which quickly become obsolete\\nas technology advances—what qualifies as “small” today may be “large” tomorrow.\\n• Practicality. The definition is likely to have much wider generality if it is grounded in\\npractical use, reflecting the real-world goal of deploying SLMs on widely available consumer\\ndevices, where they can serve the user in their proximity with low-latency inference.\\n• Motivation alignment. The definition should capture the fundamental motivation that\\ndrives the training of SLMs in the first place, which is to enable capable language models\\nthat can run on-device or within significantly constrained budgets compared to LLMs.\\nWe find definition WD1 to possess all three. Definition WD2 is then phrased to complement the set\\nof all language models.\\nA.2 Limit argument\\nTo explore the distinction between small and large language models in the context of agentic AI, let\\nus adopt the uncompromising lens of an extremalist, for whom intelligence must be either maximally\\nsmall or maximally large.\\nImagine a super-intelligent system spanning galactic scales, marshaling all available matter to\\noptimize its computations. Such a system, while theoretically capable of addressing profound\\nquestions would face insurmountable physical constraints. The speed of light limits communication,\\nwith round-trip delays across a galaxy potentially spanning tens of thousands of years [ 59]. This\\nlatency precludes real-time coordination, fragmenting the system into loosely coupled components\\nrather than a unified \"mind\". At cosmological scales, spanning millions or billions of light-years,\\ncommunication delays could approach or exceed the universe’s age of 13.8 billion years [13]. Such a\\nsystem, while vast, would be impractical for human-relevant applications, its computations unfolding\\nover eons.\\nConversely, consider an infinitely small intelligent system, reduced to the minimal substrate capable\\nof computation. Such a system, akin to the simplest biological organisms, would lack the sensors,\\neffectors, or computational capacity to meaningfully interact with its environment. Its intelligence\\nwould be constrained to rudimentary evolution, much like early life forms that emerged 3.5 billion\\nyears ago [62]. Yet, even in nature, scale varies dramatically: living organisms range from bacteria\\n(hundreds of nanometers) to blue whales (up to 30 meters), the heaviest ones being limited by heat\\ndissipation due to their high volume-to-surface ratio [ 23]. At the cosmic scale, all terrestrial life\\nappears microscopic, suggesting that absolute size is less critical than functional adaptability.\\nHereby: Humans, often regarded as a pinnacle of intelligence, offer a useful anchor for defining SLMs\\nand LLMs. With a brain-to-body mass ratio surpassed only by small mammals like mice [45], humans\\nbalance computational efficiency with practical embodiment. SLMs, by analogy, are systems compact\\nenough to run on personal devices, be trained with modest human interaction, or perform constrained,\\nverifiable tasks. LLMs, in contrast, demand datacenter-scale infrastructure, organization-level training,\\nand extensive validation, reflecting their computational load. The extremalist perspective hints at a\\nprofound truth: intelligence is not defined by size alone but by the balance of capability, efficiency,\\nand context. For agentic workflows, SLMs may offer agility and accessibility, while LLMs provide\\ndepth at the cost of scale.\\nIt is because of this apparent continuum that, if pressed to provide a definition of SLMs, we choose to\\nanchor it in characteristics of a model that can be deployed in a distributed fashion with present-day\\ntechnology and be interactive enough when engaging with a human to be of utility. Proceeding in\\nsuch a way, the contemporary instances of the definition will evolve as the technology underpinning\\nthese models advances, making the definition sufficiently timeless to be practical.\\n15'),\n",

I N T RO D U C T I O N\\nIn modern agriculture, precise plant phenotyping is essential\\nfor advancing crop breeding programs, optimizing agricultural\\npractices, and addressing the global challenge of food security\\n[1]. With the growing demand for food driven by an expanding\\npopulation, alongside challenges posed by climate change\\nand limited arable land, the development of efﬁcient and\\naccurate methods for analyzing plant traits has become a crit-\\nical priority [2]. Among various traits, accurate segmentation\\nand identiﬁcation of leaves during the early stages of crop\\ndevelopment are particularly important for understanding crop\\nhealth, growth dynamics, and development across different\\ncrop varieties. However, automated analysis of these traits re-\\nmains challenging due to occlusion, environmental variability ,\\nand the complex morphology of crop plants.\\nTraditional plant phenotyping methods rely heavily on man-\\nual observations and measurements [3]. While these methods\\nhave served as the foundation of crop breeding for decades,\\nthey are inherently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone\\nto human error. These limitations make them unsuitable for\\nlarge-scale breeding programs, where evaluating numerous\\ntraits across extensive populations is required. Additionally ,\\nthe increasing adoption of precision agriculture underscores\\nthe need for high-throughput and non-destructive phenotyping\\ntechniques that enhance the efﬁciency and sustainability of\\nmodern farming systems [4].\\nEarly-stage leaf identiﬁcation and counting play a crucial\\nrole in monitoring crop health, understanding growth patterns,\\nand evaluating early-stage crop maturity [5]. Accurate iden-\\ntiﬁcation of leaves provides valuable insights for breeders,\\nenabling a better understanding of growth dynamics and\\nsupporting the selection of superior crop varieties. Moreover,\\nsegmentation is critical for estimating the Leaf Area Index\\n(LAI), a key metric for understanding crop growth and canopy\\nstructure [6]. LAI estimation plays a vital role in predicting\\nphotosynthetic efﬁciency , yield potential, and resource allo-\\ncation in plants. However, manual counting is impractical for\\nlarge-scale studies under diverse ﬁeld conditions, necessitating\\nautomated solutions enabled by advancements in artiﬁcial\\nintelligence (AI) and computer vision [7].\\nClassical approaches to leaf counting have primarily relied\\non manual or semi-automated methods. These techniques often\\ninvolve human experts counting leaves in the ﬁeld [4]. Image\\nprocessing methods, such as edge detection, thresholding, and\\nregion-based segmentation, have also been applied to digital\\nimages of crops [8]. While these methods show promise in\\ncontrolled environments, their effectiveness diminishes under\\nreal-world conditions where variability in lighting, occlusion,\\nand plant morphology present signiﬁcant challenges. Further-\\nmore, many classical methods are tailored to speciﬁc crop\\ntypes, limiting their applicability across multiple species [9].\\nT o the best of our knowledge, no prior work has comprehen-\\nsively addressed early-stage leaf segmentation and counting\\nacross multiple crop types—including spring barley , spring\\nwheat, winter wheat, winter rye, and winter triticale—under\\ndiverse ﬁeld conditions, highlighting a gap in the literature.\\nRecent advancements in AI, particularly in deep learning\\nand computer vision, have transformed plant phenotyping by\\nenabling automated analysis [10, 11]. State-of-the-art models\\nsuch as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and object\\ndetection frameworks have demonstrated remarkable success\\nin tasks such as segmentation of crop leaves, early-stage trait\\nanalysis, and biomass estimation [7, 12, 13]. Additionally ,\\nhigh-throughput phenotyping platforms using unmanned aerial\\nvehicles (UA Vs) and robotic systems equipped with advanced\\nimaging sensors have made large-scale data collection feasible\\n[14].\\nDespite these advancements, existing AI-driven methods\\noften face signiﬁcant limitations when applied to diverse crop\\ntypes and real-world ﬁeld conditions. Challenges such as\\nvariable lighting, occlusion from overlapping plant structures,\\nand the inherent diversity of crop morphologies pose barriers'),\n",

D ATA S E T OV E RV I E W\\nThe dataset used in this study was collected from ﬁve\\nagricultural ﬁelds at the University of Copenhagen. It included\\nimages from ﬁve different crops: spring barley , spring wheat,\\nwinter wheat, winter rye, and winter triticale. The primary\\nobjective of this dataset was to support leaf segmentation\\ntasks, with leaves manually annotated in green for visibility ,\\nas shown in Fig. 1. Sample images from the dataset illustrated\\nthe diversity in crop types and imaging conditions. The manual\\nannotations focused on leaves, which were often challenging\\nto distinguish in raw images, emphasizing the dataset’s im-\\nportance in segmentation tasks. These annotations provided\\nessential ground truth data for developing and evaluating\\nsegmentation models.\\nThe dataset was acquired using two distinct platforms:\\nspring barley and spring wheat images were collected using\\nan agricultural robot, which had an overall height of approx-\\nimately 2.15 meters, a ground clearance of 80 cm, and an\\nimage resolution of 2448 × 2048. winter wheat, winter rye,\\nand winter triticale images were captured using a drone ﬂying\\nat an altitude of 8 meters with an image resolution of 5280 ×\\n395. The image sources and heights are detailed in Fig. 1.\\nThe dataset consisted of 907 training and 112 testing images\\nacross all crop types, with a notable imbalance in distribution.\\nSpeciﬁcally , spring barley had 419 training images and 43\\ntesting images, while spring wheat had 410 training images\\nand 38 testing images. The winter crops—winter wheat, winter\\nrye, and winter triticale—were evenly distributed, with each\\nhaving 25 training images and 3 testing images, as shown in\\nFig. 2.\\nIn addition to the image distribution, the number of an-\\nnotated leaves in the dataset was a critical aspect. Fig. 3\\nshows the leaf count for each crop type in the training and\\ntesting datasets. The spring barley training set contained 4,987\\nleaves, with 646 in the testing set.

Applications in Agriculture\\nThe architectural enhancements in YOLOv11, as depicted\\nin Fig. 5, make it particularly well-suited for agricultural\\napplications.

The results are summarized\\nbelow , with detailed analysis and visualizations provided in\\nFig. 6–9 and T ABLE II.\\nA. Loss and Convergence Analysis\\nFig. 6 illustrates the training and validation loss curves for\\nBBox and segmentation tasks across all crop types. Models\\ntrained on the combined dataset consistently exhibited lower\\nloss values during training and validation, particularly for\\nspring crops. This reﬂects the ability of the combined dataset\\nto provide more diverse and representative features, facilitating\\nbetter generalization. In contrast, models trained on individual\\ndatasets had higher loss values, especially for winter crops, un-\\nderscoring the challenges posed by limited data and increased\\nvariability .\\nB. Precision and Recall Analysis\\nFig. 7 presents the precision and recall curves for BBox and\\nsegmentation tasks. Models trained on the combined dataset\\nconsistently achieved higher precision and recall values for\\nboth spring and winter crops, with a more noticeable advantage\\nfor bounding box tasks. For instance, spring barley and spring\\nwheat achieved over 0.9 precision and recall for BBox tasks\\nwhen using the combined dataset. However, for segmentation\\ntasks, the difference between combined and individual datasets\\nwas smaller, particularly for winter crops, where the individual\\ndatasets occasionally outperformed the combined dataset in\\nrecall. This indicates that while the combined dataset enhances\\ngeneralization, speciﬁc nuances of individual crops may still\\nrequire specialized training.\\nC. Mean Average Precision (mAP) Analysis\\nThe mAP metrics for BBox and segmentation tasks, as\\nshown in Fig. 8, further highlight the superior performance of\\nthe combined dataset. For spring crops, the mAP@50 values\\nfor both BBox and segmentation exceeded 0.85, with segmen-\\ntation metrics slightly trailing BBox metrics. For winter crops,\\nthe combined dataset still outperformed individual datasets in\\nBBox mAP , achieving values above 0.7, while segmentation\\nmAP remained lower due to the inherent challenges of fewer\\nsamples and more complex imaging conditions. The combined\\ndataset’s higher mAP values indicate its ability to leverage\\ncross-crop similarities for robust detection.\\nD. P erformance Metrics Overview\\nThe quantitative metrics summarized in T ABLE II under-\\nscore the combined dataset’s advantage across most tasks.\\nFor instance, spring barley achieved a BBox mAP@50 of\\n0.881 and a segmentation mAP@50 of 0.822 using the com-\\nbined dataset, compared to 0.755 and 0.604, respectively ,'),\n",

LAI estimation relies heavily on accurate\\ndetection and segmentation of leaves, particularly under dense\\ncanopy conditions, where overlapping leaves and occlusion\\npresent challenges. By providing high-resolution segmentation\\noutputs, YOLOv11 can facilitate the derivation of LAI met-\\nrics, which are instrumental for understanding photosynthetic\\nefﬁciency , water use, and light interception in crops. This\\nmakes it an indispensable tool in optimizing crop management\\nand modeling resource allocation under real-world agricultural\\nconditions.\\nOne signiﬁcant ﬁnding of this study is that the combined\\ndataset generally led to improved performance, particularly for\\nbounding box tasks, largely due to its larger size and diversity .\\nHowever, this improvement was not universal. For segmenta-\\ntion tasks, individual models occasionally outperformed the\\nuniﬁed model for certain crops, such as winter wheat and\\nwinter triticale. This suggests that while a larger dataset helps\\ngeneralization, speciﬁc nuances and challenges associated\\nwith particular crops, such as unique leaf morphologies or\\nenvironmental conditions, may require specialized training.\\nFor instance, winter crops often face greater occlusion and\\nvariability in natural ﬁeld conditions, which could limit the\\nbeneﬁts of a generalized model [19].\\nOne of the most critical areas for future research is\\nthe expansion of annotated datasets to enhance the model’s\\nperformance and generalization capabilities [20]. Increasing\\nthe volume and diversity of annotated data is paramount,\\nparticularly for crops with smaller datasets, such as winter\\nwheat, winter rye, and winter triticale. Larger datasets will\\nenable the model to better capture the inherent variability\\nin leaf morphology , growth stages, and environmental con-\\nditions, leading to more robust detection across all crop types.\\nFurthermore, increasing the diversity of annotated data by\\nincluding samples from multiple geographical regions and\\nagricultural practices will enhance the model’s adaptability .

RELATED WORK \\nImage captioning has been a subject of extensive \\nresearch in recent years, driven by the growing \\ninterest in multimodal learning and visual -\\nlinguistic understanding. V arious approaches have \\nbeen proposed to tackle this challenging task, \\nleveraging the syner gy between computer vision \\nand natural language processing. Some notable \\ncontributions include: \\nImage captioning using an encoder-decoder \\nframework with a long short -term memory \\n(LSTM) network. Their model generated captions \\nby attending to relevant image regions and \\nachieved promising results on benchmark datasets  \\n[2]. \\nAn alternative to the LSTM -based models \\nby employing a semantic attention mechanism that \\naligns visual and semantic features. Their approach \\ndemonstrated enhanced int erpretability and \\ngenerated captions that align better with human \\nperception. We used the encoder and decoder \\nmodel along with LSTM and CNN.[3] \\nBottom-Up and Top -Down (BUTD) \\nattention, which utilized object detection features \\nfrom F aster R -CNN as input to the image \\ncaptioning model. This method demonstrated \\nsuperior performance in describing fine -grained \\ndetails and complex scenes.[5] \\nWhile these previous works have made \\nsubstantial progress in image captioning, several \\nchallenges remain unaddressed. For instance, the \\ngeneration of diverse and contextually consistent \\ncaptions for images with multiple objects or \\ncomplex scenes is still an open problem. Moreover, \\nscalability and efficiency remain importa nt \\nconsiderations in deploying image captioning \\nmodels in real-world applications. \\n \\nIII PROPOSED METHODOLOGY \\n \\nA) Dataset Description \\nThe dataset comprises a collection of 8,000 \\nhigh-quality images, each accompanied by five \\nhuman-written captions. The images in the dataset \\nare sourced from the photo-sharing platform Flickr \\nand represent a diverse range of scenes, objects, \\nand activities. The captions provided for each \\nimage capture different aspects and perspectives, \\nmaking the dataset suitable for evaluating the \\ndiversity and contextuality of image captioning \\nmodels. \\n \\nB) Hardware and Software Used: \\nThe code is tested in both Jupyter notebook \\nand Google Colab. Graphics Processing Unit GPU \\nis used  for the faster computation.  The deep \\nlearning framework Tensorflow i s developed by \\nGoogle can support both CPU and GPU. It is used \\nto build the CNN models. \\n \\nC) Feature Extraction \\nFeature Extraction is the main part of Computer \\nvision related projects. It involves transforming \\nraw data into a more concise, informative \\nrepresentation, capturing relevant patterns and \\ncharacteristics. Common methods include PCA, \\nLDA, and deep learning techniques like CNNs. \\nEffective feature extraction enhances model \\nperformance and facilitates better decision-making \\nin various applications.

Table 2 explains on how layers will \\nbe present in CNN models [table2] \\nLeNet 5:  LeNet is one of the earliest CNN \\narchitectures, with relatively fewer layers and small \\nfilter sizes (typically 5x5 or smaller). It is \\ncommonly used for handwritten digit recognition \\nand serves as the foundation for modern CNNs. \\nAlexNet: AlexNet, introduce d in 2012, was the \\nfirst deep CNN to demonstrate the effectiveness of \\nusing ReLU activation functions. It consists of \\neight convolutional layers and is deeper than \\nLeNet, making it a breakthrough in the field of \\ncomputer vision. \\nVGG16 and VGG19:  VGG16 and VGG19 are \\ncharacterized by their uniform architecture, with \\nmany layers using small 3x3 filters. They are \\nknown for their simplicity and interpretability but \\nare computationally more expensive due to their \\ndepth. \\nGoogleNet: GoogleNet (InceptionV1) introduc ed \\nthe concept of inception modules, which employ \\nparallel convolutional filters of different sizes to \\ncapture multi -scale features efficiently. It was \\ndesigned to strike a balance between depth and \\ncomputational cost. \\nResNet 50: ResNet 50, part of the Res Net family, \\nis known for its deep residual architecture. It \\nintroduced skip connections, allowing gradients to \\nflow more effectively during training, enabling \\ntraining of very deep networks with improved \\nperformance. \\nHere the last layer of all the models Is removed \\nbecause we are only training the model \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nG) Data Pipeline \\nData generator function preprocesses \\nimage-caption pairs for image captioning model \\ntraining. It iterates through images and associated \\ncaptions, encodes sequences, splits them into input \\nand output pairs, pads input sequences, and one-hot \\nencodes output sequences.  \\nText to sequences : Each text is converted into a \\nsequence of integers based on the vocabulary index \\nof the respective words in the text. The resulting \\nsequences can be used as inputs to train and \\nevaluate natural language processing models, such \\nas text classification, sentiment analysis, or image \\ncaptioning. \\nPad sequences:  It is a frequently employed \\nfunction in natural language processing. It \\nfacilitates uniform sequence lengths by padding \\nshorter sequences with zeros and truncating longer \\nsequences. This ensures compatibility with deep \\nlearning models that demand fixed input sizes, \\nenhancing overall model performance. \\n \\n0) Concatenated Model \\nDropout is used for better performance of the \\nmodel. The input is extracted features from the \\nCNN model. Now on the other hand RNN model \\nLSTM is taken along with embedding with size of \\nvocabulary. The LSTM has 256 neurons with \\nReLU activation function.

An example is the popular N-gram model\\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks.

We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

This choice has several good\\nreasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of\\ndata outperform complex systems trained on less data. An example is the popular N-gram model\\nused for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train N-grams on virtually all available\\ndata (trillions of words [3]).\\nHowever, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. For example, the amount of\\nrelevant in-domain data for automatic speech recognition is limited - the performance is usually\\ndominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (often just millions of words).

       " 'data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art perfor-\\nmance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.\\n1 Introduction\\nMany current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units - there is no notion of similar-\\nity between words, as these are represented as indices in a vocabulary.

The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

      "\n",
      "2. **Data curation & filtering (S2)** – Pull the logged traces, remove noisy or privacy‑sensitive entries, and group them by task or domain (e.g., code generation, web‑search, summarisation).  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Task‑level clustering (S3)** – Cluster the curated traces to discover recurring sub‑tasks that can be handled by a specialist model rather than a general‑purpose LLM.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Specialist‑model training (S4)** – For each cluster, fine‑tune a small‑scale LM (≤10 B parameters) on the corresponding subset of data, optimizing for latency, memory footprint, and task‑specific metrics.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evaluation & benchmarking (S5)** – Compare each specialist SLM against the original LLM on held‑out traces for accuracy, latency, and resource usage. Retain only those that meet a predefined performance‑cost threshold.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Agent re‑architecture (S6)** – Modify the agent’s orchestration layer to route incoming requests to the appropriate specialist SLM (or fall back to the LLM when no specialist matches).  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Gradual rollout & monitoring (S7)** – Deploy the hybrid system incrementally, monitor real‑world latency, error rates, and cost, and iteratively refine the specialist pool.  \n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Continuous feedback loop (S8)** – Feed new usage logs back into steps S1–S5 to keep specialists up‑to‑date and to discover emerging tasks that merit new SLMs.  \n",
