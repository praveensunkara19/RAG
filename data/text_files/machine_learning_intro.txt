Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed [1, 2]. The core idea is to build systems that can automatically learn to identify patterns, make predictions, or generate insights based on historical information. 
Core Concepts
Data: ML models learn from data, which can include images, text, numbers, or sound. The quality and quantity of this data are crucial for effective learning [1].
Algorithms: These are the methods and mathematical formulas used by computers to process data and find patterns. Common examples include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks [1, 3].
Training: This is the process where the algorithm analyzes the data to learn patterns. The resulting learned patterns form a "model" [1].
Model: The output of the training process. Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data [1]. 
Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning is typically divided into three main categories based on how the learning process is supervised [1, 2]: 
Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data has a corresponding "correct" output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs [1].
Examples: Spam detection (identifying emails as "spam" or "not spam"), predicting house prices based on features like size and location [1].
Unsupervised Learning: The model is given unlabeled data and must find its own patterns and structures within the data. There are no "correct" outputs provided [1].
Examples: Customer segmentation (grouping customers with similar behaviors), anomaly detection (identifying unusual activities in a system) [1].
Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns to make decisions through trial and error in an interactive environment. It receives rewards for desirable actions and penalties for undesirable ones, aiming to maximize its cumulative reward [1, 2].
Examples: Training a self-driving car to navigate traffic, game AI (like AlphaGo or chess engines) [1, 2]. 
Key Applications
Machine learning is ubiquitous in modern life [1]: 
Recommendation Systems: Services like Netflix and Amazon use ML to suggest movies or products you might like [1].
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables computers to understand human language, used in virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), translation tools (Google Translate), and chatbots [1].
Computer Vision: Allows computers to "see" and interpret images and videos, used in facial recognition, medical imaging analysis, and self-driving cars [1, 2].
Healthcare: ML models help diagnose diseases earlier, analyze medical images, and personalize treatment plans [1, 2]. 
In essence, machine learning is a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from data, enabling smarter, more efficient systems across a vast array of industries
